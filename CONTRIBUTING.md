For detailed testing instructions, refer to the [TESTING](testing/README.md) document.

### Pre-commit checks

Run the formatter and lints before committing to maintain code consistency and catch common issues early.

```bash
# Format code (modify files)
cargo fmt

# Check formatting (CI-friendly; fails if unformatted)
cargo fmt -- --check

# Run Clippy
cargo clippy

# Optionally apply fixable Clippy suggestions locally
cargo fix --clippy
```

### Code quality expectations

1. Ensure the pipeline checks are finished successfully.
2. Ensure the pull request doesn't contain redundant comments, console.log, etc.
3. Ensure your code is covered with unit and integration tests (NOTE: no mocks/stubs in integration tests).
4. Avoid adding comments to explain what code does, code should be self-explanatory and clean.
5. Avoid using variable names like `i` or abbreviations - names should be simple and unambiguous.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Avoiding obvious comments about things like code styling and indentation.
  ** If you see yourself wanting to do that more than once - open an issue with a repo to update the ESLint/Prettier rules to address this concern once and for all. **Code reviews should be about logic, not indenting or adding more newlines\*\*

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
